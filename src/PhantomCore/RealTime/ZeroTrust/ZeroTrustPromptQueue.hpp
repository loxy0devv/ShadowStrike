 * @brief Bounded asynchronous prompt queue for uncertain-verdict user prompts.
 *
 * When ZeroTrustGuard emits Verdict::Uncertain with UncertainBehavior::Prompt,
 * the execution hook enqueues a PromptEntry here and may block on WaitFor()
 * until the UI IPC layer delivers an Answer(). The queue is bounded to 64
 * pending entries; overflow evicts the oldest pending entry with Timeout.
 *
 * The queue is a standalone Meyers' singleton so it can be driven by both
 * the ZeroTrustGuard (producer) and the home-ipc-dispatcher (consumer).
