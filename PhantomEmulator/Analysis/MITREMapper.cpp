 * MITREMapper.cpp — MITRE ATT&CK Enterprise technique mapping
 *
 * Maps detected behavioral signals to MITRE ATT&CK techniques. Covers
 * ~91 techniques across all 11 tactics (Execution through Impact).
 * Each mapping records evidence — the specific behavioral indicator that
 * triggered the technique — for forensic reporting.
 *
 * Technique deduplication: if the same technique ID is mapped multiple
 * times, only the highest-confidence instance is kept, but all evidence
 * strings are accumulated.
 *
 * Kill-chain coverage is computed as the number of distinct tactics observed,
 * which correlates with attack sophistication.
